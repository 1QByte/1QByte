# Hey everyone, I am Iqbra Kurniawan! 👋

I never thought I would pursue a career in programming, xixi. A lot of challenges, but hope I can be a great programmer 👨🏽‍💻

```kotlin
class Person {
    private var name: String = "Iqbra Kurniawan"
    private var major: String = "Informatics Management"

    fun sayHello() {
        println("Hey, thank you for visiting my GitHub profile!")
    }

    // Programming languages that I have learned
    fun showProgrammingLanguages() {
        val programmingLanguages = listOf(
            "Kotlin",
            "Python",
            "SQL",
            "Java",
            "PHP",
            "C++"
        )
    }

    fun getInterests(): ArrayList<String> {
        val interests = arrayListOf(
            "Mobile Development",
            "Algorithm & Engineering",
            "Arts: movie, music, and literature"
        )
        return interests
    }
}
